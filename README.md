# CaesarCipherEncryption_Decryption
This repository contains Python scripts for encrypting and decrypting passwords using a simple Caesar cipher encryption technique.


## Description:

This repository contains Python scripts for encrypting and decrypting passwords using a simple Caesar cipher encryption technique. The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet. In this implementation, the password is encrypted by shifting each lowercase letter by 3 positions in the alphabet, wrapping around if necessary. The encrypted password can then be decrypted back to the original password using the reverse process.

## Encryption Process:

- The user is prompted to enter a password.
- Each lowercase letter in the password is shifted by 3 positions in the alphabet, preserving the case of the letters. Non-letter characters remain unchanged.
- The encrypted password is displayed to the user.
## Decryption Process:

- The user is prompted to enter the encrypted password.
- Each lowercase letter in the encrypted password is shifted back by 3 positions in the alphabet to decrypt the original password. Non-letter characters remain unchanged.
- The decrypted password is displayed to the user.

Feel free to use, modify, and improve these scripts for your encryption and decryption needs. Happy coding!
